(because we wouldn\u0027t want to expose it more widely than necessary.)\n\ni think the obvious alternative would be to instead document that adding process_madvise() to bionic, rather than just using syscall() for the single caller of that, was probably a mistake? that would at least make it more obvious why we have this asymmetry in the header...",
