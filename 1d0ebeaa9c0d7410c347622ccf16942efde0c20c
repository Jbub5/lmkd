      "message": "Since \u0027size\u0027 is of type size_t, which is unsigned, this will always be false and we won\u0027t catch this error.  read() returns a ssize_t, and I think we want to use an ssize_t here.  I don\u0027t know how we want to mix that with the other uses of \u0027size\u0027 in here (write() does us a size_t, not an ssize_t, for it\u0027s argument), perhaps just a cast for this comparison?  Whatever we chose, it seems like we should change this code (or remove this check if it\u0027s not important).  Thanks!",
