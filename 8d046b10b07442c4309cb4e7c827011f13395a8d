      "message": "Not quite. Total GPU includes:\nprivate allocations by GPU driver (alloc_pages/kmalloc/etc)\ndmabufs exported by GPU driver\n\nSo there is an overlap between dmabuf heaps and GPU (some dmabufs from dmabuf heaps are also included in total GPU).\nHowever there is no overlap between GPU total and dmabuf heap pools because pools contain only buffers which are currently unused.
