      "message": "Hmm. Are you saying that `procp-\u003eoomadj` changes between here and when we call `killinfo_log` at line 2396? That I think can\u0027t happen because reaper does not modify `procp-\u003eoomadj`. The only place it can be modified is in `cmd_procprio` which runs in the same main thread as `kill_one_process`, therefore can\u0027t race with this code.\n\nPlease clarify the scenario that you are experiencing. From this change it\u0027s still unclear why you would get a wrong procp-\u003eoomadj at the time of `killinfo_log` call.",
